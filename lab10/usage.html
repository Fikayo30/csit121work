    <h2>How is WoT Discovery Used?</h2>
   <p>In order to employ WoT Discovery, devices deliver Thing Descriptions (TDs) through a variety of channels, including direct advertising and directory service registration. These announcements can be subscribed to or searched by other devices or applications to locate devices within the network.</p>    <p>For example, a smart thermostat can announce itself on the network using multicast. A mobile app can detect it and automatically present controls to the user, based on the TD provided.</p>
<p>Multicast, for instance, can be used by a smart thermostat to broadcast itself throughout the network. Based on the given TD, a mobile app can identify it and provide the user the controls automatically.</p>  </main>
<p>Developers use industry-standard protocols like HTTP, CoAP, and MQTT to accomplish WoT Discovery. For machine readability, the Thing Descriptions are usually saved in JSON-LD format.</p>
